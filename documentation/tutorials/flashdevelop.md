# FlashDevelop

If you are using FlashDevelop for HaxePunk, and want a quick way to create new projects, then this is for you. Drag and drop [HXPTemplate.fdz](https://github.com/HaxePunk/FlashDevelop/raw/master/HXPTemplate.fdz) to FlashDevelop, OR
copy $(BaseDir) contents from the [FlashDevelop Template](https://github.com/HaxePunk/FlashDevelop) to your FlashDevelop installation folder. That's all there is to it!

If you need to change the OpenFL target you can do so in the project properties. Make sure you have Visual Studio installed if you plan to compile the native version.
