  loaded image file(JPEG, GIF, or PNG). LoaderInfo objects are available for
  any display object. The information provided includes load progress, the
  URLs of the loader and loaded content, the number of bytes total for the
  media, and the nominal height and width of the media.</p>
<p><p>You can access LoaderInfo objects in two ways: </p></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>The <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of a flash.display.Loader
  object -  The <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property is always available
  for any Loader object. For a Loader object that has not called the
  <code>load()</code> or <code>loadBytes()</code> method, or that has not
  sufficiently loaded, attempting to access many of the properties of the
  <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property throws an error.</li>
    <li>The <code>loaderInfo</code> property of a display object. </li>
  </ul></p>
<p><p>The <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of a Loader object provides
  information about the content that the Loader object is loading, whereas
  the <code>loaderInfo</code> property of a DisplayObject provides
  information about the root SWF file for that display object. </p></p>
<p><p>When you use a Loader object to load a display object(such as a SWF
  file or a bitmap), the <code>loaderInfo</code> property of the display
  object is the same as the <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of the
  Loader object(<code>DisplayObject.loaderInfo =
  Loader.contentLoaderInfo</code>). Because the instance of the main class of
  the SWF file has no Loader object, the <code>loaderInfo</code> property is
  the only way to access the LoaderInfo for the instance of the main class of
  the SWF file.</p></p>
<p><p>The following diagram shows the different uses of the LoaderInfo
  object - for the instance of the main class of the SWF file, for the
  <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of a Loader object, and for the
  <code>loaderInfo</code> property of a loaded object:</p></p>
<p><p>When a loading operation is not complete, some properties of the
  <code>contentLoaderInfo</code> property of a Loader object are not
  available. You can obtain some properties, such as
  <code>bytesLoaded</code>, <code>bytesTotal</code>, <code>url</code>,
  <code>loaderURL</code>, and <code>applicationDomain</code>. When the
  <code>loaderInfo</code> object dispatches the <code>init</code> event, you
  can access all properties of the <code>loaderInfo</code> object and the
  loaded image or SWF file.</p></p>
<p><p><b>Note:</b> All properties of LoaderInfo objects are read-only.</p></p>
<p><p>The <code>EventDispatcher.dispatchEvent()</code> method is not
  applicable to LoaderInfo objects. If you call <code>dispatchEvent()</code>
  on a LoaderInfo object, an IllegalOperationError exception is thrown.</p></p>
<p>@event complete   Dispatched when data has loaded successfully. In other
                    words, it is dispatched when all the content has been
                    downloaded and the loading has finished. The
                    <code>complete</code> event is always dispatched after
                    the <code>init</code> event. The <code>init</code> event
                    is dispatched when the object is ready to access, though
                    the content may still be downloading.
  @event httpStatus Dispatched when a network request is made over HTTP and
                    an HTTP status code can be detected.
  @event init       Dispatched when the properties and methods of a loaded
                    SWF file are accessible and ready for use. The content,
                    however, can still be downloading. A LoaderInfo object
                    dispatches the <code>init</code> event when the following
                    conditions exist:
                    <ul>
                      <li>All properties and methods associated with the
                    loaded object and those associated with the LoaderInfo
                    object are accessible.</li>
                      <li>The constructors for all child objects have
                    completed.</li>
                      <li>All ActionScript code in the first frame of the
                    loaded SWF's main timeline has been executed.</li>
                    </ul></p>
<p><p>For example, an <code>Event.INIT</code> is dispatched
                    when the first frame of a movie or animation is loaded.
                    The movie is then accessible and can be added to the
                    display list. The complete movie, however, can take
                    longer to download. The <code>Event.COMPLETE</code> is
                    only dispatched once the full movie is loaded.</p></p>
<p><p>The <code>init</code> event always precedes the
                    <code>complete</code> event.</p>
  @event ioError    Dispatched when an input or output error occurs that
                    causes a load operation to fail.
  @event open       Dispatched when a load operation starts.
  @event progress   Dispatched when data is received as the download
                    operation progresses.
  @event unload     Dispatched by a LoaderInfo object whenever a loaded
                    object is removed by using the <code>unload()</code>
                    method of the Loader object, or when a second load is
                    performed by the same Loader object and the original
                    content is removed prior to the load beginning.</p></div><dl><dt><span class="kwd">var </span>actionScriptVersion(default,null) : <a href="../../flash/display/ActionScriptVersion.html" class="type">ActionScriptVersion</a></dt><dd><p>The ActionScript version of the loaded SWF file.
