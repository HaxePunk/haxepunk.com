  render when drawing triangle paths.</p>
<p><p> The terms <code>POSITIVE</code> and <code>NEGATIVE</code> refer to the
  sign of a triangle's normal along the z-axis. The normal is a 3D vector
  that is perpendicular to the surface of the triangle. </p></p>
<p><p> A triangle whose vertices 0, 1, and 2 are arranged in a clockwise order
  has a positive normal value. That is, its normal points in a positive
  z-axis direction, away from the current view point. When the
  <code>TriangleCulling.POSITIVE</code> algorithm is used, triangles with
  positive normals are not rendered. Another term for this is backface
  culling. </p></p>
<p><p> A triangle whose vertices are arranged in a counter-clockwise order has
  a negative normal value. That is, its normal points in a negative z-axis
  direction, toward the current view point. When the
  <code>TriangleCulling.NEGATIVE</code> algorithm is used, triangles with
  negative normals will not be rendered. </p></p></div><dl><dt>NEGATIVE</dt><dd> Specifies culling of all triangles facing toward the current view point.</dd><dt>NONE</dt><dd> Specifies no culling.
