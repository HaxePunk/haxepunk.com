  environment's support for handling contact from user input devices,
  including contact that has two or more touch points(such as a user's
  fingers on a touch screen). When a user interacts with a device such as a
  mobile phone or tablet with a touch screen, the user typically touches the
  screen with his or her fingers or a pointing device. While there is a broad
  range of pointing devices, such as a mouse or a stylus, many of these
  devices only have a single point of contact with an application. For
  pointing devices with a single point of contact, user interaction events
  can be handled as a mouse event, or using a basic set of touch events
  (called "touch point" events). However, for pointing devices that have
  several points of contact and perform complex movement, such as the human
  hand, Flash runtimes support an additional set of event handling API called
  gesture events. The API for handling user interaction with these gesture
  events includes the following classes:</p>
<p><p>
  <ul>
    <li>flash.events.TouchEvent</li>
    <li>flash.events.GestureEvent</li>
    <li>flash.events.GesturePhase</li>
    <li>flash.events.TransformGestureEvent</li>
    <li>flash.events.PressAndTapGestureEvent</li>
  </ul>
  </p></p>
<p><p>Use the listed classes to write code that handles touch events. Use the
  Multitouch class to determine the current environment's support for touch
  interaction, and to manage the support of touch interaction if the current
  environment supports touch input.</p></p>
<p><p>You cannot create a Multitouch object directly from ActionScript code.
  If you call <code>new Multitouch()</code>, an exception is thrown.</p></p>
<p><p><b>Note:</b> The Multitouch feature is not supported for SWF files
  embedded in HTML running on Mac OS.</p></p></div><dl><dt><span class="kwd">static </span><span class="kwd">var </span>inputMode : <a href="../../flash/ui/MultitouchInputMode.html" class="type">MultitouchInputMode</a></dt><dd><p>Identifies the multi-touch mode for touch and gesture event handling.
