The Sound class
  lets you create a Sound object, load and play an external MP3 file into
  that object, close the sound stream, and access data about the sound, such
  as information about the number of bytes in the stream and ID3 metadata.
  More detailed control of the sound is performed through the sound source
   -  the SoundChannel or Microphone object for the sound  -  and through the
  properties in the SoundTransform class that control the output of the sound
  to the computer's speakers.</p>
<p><p>In Flash Player 10 and later and AIR 1.5 and later, you can also use
  this class to work with sound that is generated dynamically. In this case,
  the Sound object uses the function you assign to a <code>sampleData</code>
  event handler to poll for sound data. The sound is played as it is
  retrieved from a ByteArray object that you populate with sound data. You
  can use <code>Sound.extract()</code> to extract sound data from a Sound
  object, after which you can manipulate it before writing it back to the
  stream for playback.</p></p>
<p><p>To control sounds that are embedded in a SWF file, use the properties in
  the SoundMixer class.</p></p>
<p><p><b>Note</b>: The ActionScript 3.0 Sound API differs from ActionScript
  2.0. In ActionScript 3.0, you cannot take sound objects and arrange them in
  a hierarchy to control their properties.</p></p>
<p><p>When you use this class, consider the following security model: </p></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling file is in
  a network sandbox and the sound file to be loaded is local.</li>
    <li>By default, loading and playing a sound is not allowed if the calling
  file is local and tries to load and play a remote sound. A user must grant
  explicit permission to allow this type of access.</li>
    <li>Certain operations dealing with sound are restricted. The data in a
  loaded sound cannot be accessed by a file in a different domain unless you
  implement a cross-domain policy file. Sound-related APIs that fall under
  this restriction are <code>Sound.id3</code>,
  <code>SoundMixer.computeSpectrum()</code>,
  <code>SoundMixer.bufferTime</code>, and the <code>SoundTransform</code>
  class.</li>
  </ul></p>
<p><p>However, in Adobe AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security
  sandbox(content installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by
  these security limitations.</p></p>

<p><p>MP3 sound files can contain ID3 tags, which provide metadata about the
	  file. If an MP3 sound that you load using the <code>Sound.load()</code>
	  method contains ID3 tags, you can query these properties. Only ID3 tags
	  that use the UTF-8 character set are supported.</p></p>
<p><p>Flash Player 9 and later and AIR support ID3 2.0 tags, specifically 2.3
	  and 2.4. The following tables list the standard ID3 2.0 tags and the type
	  of content the tags represent. The <code>Sound.id3</code> property
	  provides access to these tags through the format
	  <code>my_sound.id3.COMM</code>, <code>my_sound.id3.TIME</code>, and so on.
	  The first table describes tags that can be accessed either through the ID3
	  2.0 property name or the ActionScript property name. The second table
	  describes ID3 tags that are supported but do not have predefined
	  properties in ActionScript. </p></p>
<p><p>When using this property, consider the Flash Player security model:</p></p>
<p><ul>
	    <li>The <code>id3</code> property of a Sound object is always permitted
	  for SWF files that are in the same security sandbox as the sound file. For
	  files in other sandboxes, there are security checks.</li>
	    <li>When you load the sound, using the <code>load()</code> method of the
	  Sound class, you can specify a <code>context</code> parameter, which is a
	  SoundLoaderContext object. If you set the <code>checkPolicyFile</code>
	  property of the SoundLoaderContext object to <code>true</code>, Flash
	  Player checks for a URL policy file on the server from which the sound is
	  loaded. If a policy file exists and permits access from the domain of the
	  loading SWF file, then the file is allowed to access the <code>id3</code>
	  property of the Sound object; otherwise it is not.</li>
	  </ul></p>
<p><p>However, in Adobe AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security
	  sandbox(content installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by
	  these security limitations.</p></p>

	  the <code>isURLInaccessible</code> value is <code>true</code> the
	  <code>Sound.url</code> value is only the domain of the final URL from

	  sound is loaded from <code>http://www.adobe.com/assets/hello.mp3</code>,
	  and the <code>Sound.url</code> property has the value
	  <code>http://www.adobe.com</code>. The <code>isURLInaccessible</code>
	  value is <code>true</code> only when all of the following are also true:
	  <ul>
	    <li>An HTTP redirect occurred while loading the sound file.</li>
	    <li>The SWF file calling <code>Sound.load()</code> is from a different
	  domain than the sound file's final URL.</li>
	    <li>The SWF file calling <code>Sound.load()</code> does not have
	  permission to access the sound file. Permission is granted to access the
	  sound file the same way permission is granted for the
	  <code>Sound.id3</code> property: establish a policy file and use the
	  <code>SoundLoaderContext.checkPolicyFile</code> property.</li>
	  </ul></p>
<p><p><b>Note:</b> The <code>isURLInaccessible</code> property was added for
	  Flash Player 10.1 and AIR 2.0. However, this property is made available to
	  SWF files of all versions when the Flash runtime supports it. So, using
	  some authoring tools in "strict mode" causes a compilation error. To work
	  around the error use the indirect syntax
	  <code>mySound<code>"isURLInaccessible"</code></code>, or disable strict mode. If you
	  are using Flash Professional CS5 or Flex SDK 4.1, you can use and compile
	  this API for runtimes released before Flash Player 10.1 and AIR 2.</p></p>
<p><p>For application content in AIR, the value of this property is always

This property is applicable only
	  to Sound objects that were loaded using the <code>Sound.load()</code>
	  method. For Sound objects that are associated with a sound asset from a
	  SWF file's library, the value of the <code>url</code> property is
	  <code>null</code>.</p>
<p><p>When you first call <code>Sound.load()</code>, the <code>url</code>
	  property initially has a value of <code>null</code>, because the final URL
	  is not yet known. The <code>url</code> property will have a non-null value
	  as soon as an <code>open</code> event is dispatched from the Sound
	  object.</p></p>
<p><p>The <code>url</code> property contains the final, absolute URL from
	  which a sound was loaded. The value of <code>url</code> is usually the
	  same as the value passed to the <code>stream</code> parameter of
	  <code>Sound.load()</code>. However, if you passed a relative URL to
	  <code>Sound.load()</code> the value of the <code>url</code> property
	  represents the absolute URL. Additionally, if the original URL request is
	  redirected by an HTTP server, the value of the <code>url</code> property
	  reflects the final URL from which the sound file was actually downloaded.
	  This reporting of an absolute, final URL is equivalent to the behavior of
	  <code>LoaderInfo.url</code>.</p></p>
<p><p>In some cases, the value of the <code>url</code> property is truncated;
	  see the <code>isURLInaccessible</code> property for details.</p></p></dd><dt><span class="kwd">function </span>new(?stream : <a href="../../flash/net/URLRequest.html" class="type">flash.net.URLRequest</a>, ?context : <a href="../../flash/media/SoundLoaderContext.html" class="type">SoundLoaderContext</a>) : <a href="../../Void.html" class="type">Void</a></dt><dd><p>Creates a new Sound object.
