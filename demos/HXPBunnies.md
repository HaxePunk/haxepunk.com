HaxePunk BunnyMark
==================

HaxePunk port of BunnyMark Benchmark. Click the stage to add bunnies and test
performance.
 
Initial BunnyMark was created by
[Iain Lobb](http://blog.iainlobb.com/2010/11/display-list-vs-blitting-results.html)
and [Amanda Lobb](http://amandalobb.com/), then ported to haxe-NME by
[Joshua Granick](http://www.joshuagranick.com/blog/?p=508), then enhanced by
[Philippe Elsass](https://github.com/elsassph/nme-bunnymark), and finally ported
to HaxePunk by @Beeblerox.

Flash is limited to software rendering so there is a significant performance
improvement when you use cpp targets. Cpp targets make use of drawTiles GPU
Acceleration and on a desktop it can display 10,000's of bunnies with additional
variations of alpha and scaling. On the Flash target however, rendering with
alpha and scaling means a severe performance decrease.
